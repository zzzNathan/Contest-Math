\begin{document}
\maketitle

Recently I have been wanting to improve my algebra so I have been
working through \textit{101 Problems in Algebra} by
\textit{T Andreescu \& Z Feng}.

\section{Introductory Problems}

\begin{problem}{Problem 1}
Let $a,b$ and $c$ be real and positive parameters. Solve the equation

$$
\sqrt{a+bx} + \sqrt{b+cx} + \sqrt{c+ax} =
\sqrt{b-ax} + \sqrt{c-bx} + \sqrt{a-cx}
$$
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 1}
If $x$ is a solution then that equation should hold for all triplets of
parameters $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Consider the triplet
$(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$, we must have $3\sqrt{1+x} = 3\sqrt{1-x} \iff
1+x = 1-x \iff x=0$. So $x=0$ is the only candidate for a solution. Now
we can easily plug in $x=0$ into the above equation to see that it
indeed works for all $a,b,c$. Hence $x=0$ is the only such solution.

\begin{problem}{Problem 2}
Find the general term of the sequence defined by $x_0 = 3, x_1 = 4$ and

$$
x_{n+1} = x_{n-1}^2 - nx_n
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 2}
After a little exploration it is not hard to see that each term $x_r$ seems
to simply be $r+3$. This guess is easily proved since
$x_{n-1}^2 - nx_n = (n+2)^2 - n(n+3) = (n^2 + 4n + 4) - (n^2 + 3n) = n+4 =
x_{n+1}$. $\blacksquare$
\end{solution}

\vspace{0.2cm}

\begin{problem}{Problem 3}
Let \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) be a sequence of integers such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] \(-1 \leq x_i \leq 2,\) for \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, n;\)
    \item[(ii)] \(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 19;\)
    \item[(iii)] \(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 = 99.\)
\end{enumerate}

Determine the minimum and maximum possible values of
\[
x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_n^3.
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 3}
Let $a,b,c,d$ be the number of $(-1)$'s, 0's, 1's and 2's in the sequence,
respectively. We have $-a + c + 2d = 19$ and $a + c + 4d = 99$ by condition
(i) and (ii). We are interested in $x_1^3 + x_2^3 + \cdots + x_n^3 =
-a + c + 8d = -a + (19 + a - 2d) + 8d = 19 + 6d$, using $c = 19 + a - 2d$.
But since $2c + 6d = 118 \iff c = 59 - 3d$, from adding the first 2
equations and $c\geq 0 \iff 3d \leq 59$ but that means that
$0\leq d\leq 19$. So the maximum value is $19 + 6(19) = 133$ and the
minimum is $19 + 6(0) = 19$. $\blacksquare$ \\

\begin{problem}{Problem 4}
The function $f$, defined by

$$
f(x) = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}
$$

where $a,b,c$ and $d$ are non-zero real numbers, has the properties
$$
f(19) = 19, \ \ f(97) = 97, \ \  f(f(x)) = x
$$

for all $x$, except $-\frac{d}{c}$.\\

Find the range of $f$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 4}
Clearly for all $x \neq -d/c$, $x$ is in the image of $f$ due to the third
property.
Using the third property we know that $x = \frac{af(x)+b}{cf(x)+d}$ we can
re-arrange to find that $f(x) = \frac{b-dx}{cx-a} = \frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$ so
there must exist $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}$ such that
$cx-a = \lambda (cx+d)$ and $b-dx = \lambda (ax+b)$. From the second
equation $b = b \lambda$ so $\lambda = 1$ since $b \neq 0$ therefore
$a=-d$. Now using those 2 fixed points we know that

\[
\begin{aligned}
19a + b = 19^2 c - 19a\\
97a + b = 97^2 c - 97a\\
\end{aligned}
\]

We can subtract these 2 equations to get rid of $b$ and re-arrange to get
$a = 58c$. Now $-d/c = 58c/c = 58$. So since 58 isn't in the domain of $f$
and $f$ is an involution, 58 isn't in the image of $f$ either. So the range
is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 58 \}$. $\blacksquare$ \\

\begin{problem}{Problem 5}
Prove that

$$
\frac{(a-b)^2}{8a} \leq \frac{a+b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a-b)^2}{8b}
$$

for all $a\geq b >0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 5}
The inequality is the same as

$$
\frac{(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2}{8a} \leq
\frac{(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2}{2} \leq
\frac{(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2(\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2}{8b}
$$

That is

\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2}{8a} &\leq
\frac{1}{2} \leq
\frac{(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2}{8b} \\
b(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 &\leq
4ab \leq
a(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

but since $b(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 \leq b (2\sqrt{a})^2 = 4ab$ and
$4ab = a(2\sqrt{b})^2 \leq a(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2$, the problem is
finished. $\blacksquare$ \\

\begin{problem}{Problem 6}
Several (at least two) nonzero numbers are written on a board. One may
erase any two numbers, say $a$ and $b$, and then write the numbers
$a + \frac{b}{2}$ and $b - \frac{a}{2}$ instead.

Prove that the set of numbers on the board, after any number of the
preceding operations, cannot coincide with the initial set.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 6}
Suppose we apply the operation on $a$ and $b$. The sum of their
squares is $a^2 + b^2$. Now after you apply the operation, the sum of
squares becomes $(a^2 + ab + \frac{b^2}{4}) + (b^2 - ab + \frac{a^2}{4}) =
\frac{5}{4} (a^2 + b^2)$. So the sum of squares all the numbers on the
board will strictly increase after applying each operation. This means that
after some number of operations we can never coincide with the original set
because the sum of squares of the numbers on the board, before and after
the operations, will be different.
$\blacksquare$

Gowers solve invariance problems on YouTube!}

\begin{problem}{Problem 7}
The polynomial
\[
1 - x + x^{2} - x^{3} + \cdots + x^{16} - x^{17}
\]
may be written in the form
\[
a_0 + a_1 y + a_2 y^2 + \cdots + a_{16} y^{16} + a_{17} y^{17},
\]
where \( y = x + 1 \) and \( a_i \)s are constants. Find \( a_2 \).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution 7}
The polynomial in terms of $y$ is

$$
1 - (y-1) + (y-1)^2 - (y-1)^3 + \cdots + (y-1)^{16} - (y-1)^{17}
$$

and we want the coefficient of $y^2$.\\

We can use binomial expansion to
find that the coefficient is
$ a_2 = \sum_{r=2}^{17} (-1)^r \binom{r}{2} (-1)^{r-2} =
\sum_{r=2}^{17} \binom{r}{2}$. But by the Hockey stick identity this is
just $\binom{18}{3} = 816$. $\blacksquare$
