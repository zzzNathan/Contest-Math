\begin{problem}{Canadian Math Olymipad 2015 --- P1/5}
Find all functions $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for  all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$$
(n-1)^2 < f(n)f(f(n)) < n^2 + n
$$
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution}
With $(n-1)^2 < f(n)f(f(n)) < n(n+1)$, we must have

$$
\max \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} > n-1
$$

This is because if we didn't have this condition then, we would
have $f(n), f(f(n)) \leq n-1$ and $f(n)f(f(n)) \leq (n-1)^2$
which gives a contradiction. However that means that,

$$
\min \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} < n+1
$$

because we have already established that one of those factors
is at least $n$ and we must have their product be $< n(n+1)$.
\\

We can re-write our condition as

$$
(n-1)^2 < \min \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} \cdot \max \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} < n(n+1)
$$

and we can deduce both

$$
\frac{(n-1)^2}{\max \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \}} < \frac{(n-1)^2}{n-1} = n-1 < \min \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} < n+1
$$

and (using $\min \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} \leq n$)

$$
n-1 < \max \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \} < \frac{n(n+1)}{\min \{ f(n), f(f(n)) \}} \leq \frac{n(n+1)}{n} = n+1
$$

But this forces both $f(n), f(f(n)) = n$. So the only function
that works is $f(n) = n,\text{for} \; n \in \mathbb{N} \; \blacksquare$
