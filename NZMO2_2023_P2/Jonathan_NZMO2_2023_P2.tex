\begin{problem}{New Zealand Math Olympiad Round 2 2023 --- P2/5}
Let $a,b,c$ be positive reals such that $a + b + c = abc$. Prove that at
least one of $a,b,c$ is greater than $\frac{17}{10}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution}
Without loss of generality assume that $0 < c \leq b \leq a$. Now for the
sake of contradiction assume that $a \leq \frac{17}{10}$. By AM-GM we have
$\frac{1}{3}(a + b + c) \geq (abc)^{1/3} \iff \frac{1}{27}(abc)^3 \geq abc$.
But since we know that $abc \geq c^3$ we can deduce that
$\frac{1}{27}(abc)^3 \geq abc \geq c^3$ so $\frac{1}{27} (ab)^3 \geq 1$ and so
$(ab)^3 \geq 27 \iff ab \geq 3$. However since we assumed that
$a \leq \frac{17}{10}$, we have $\frac{17^2}{10^2} \geq ab \geq 3$,
that means that $\frac{289}{100} \geq 3$, but since
$\frac{289}{100} < 3$ we have a
contradiction. This completes the proof. $\blacksquare$ \\


\textit{Remark: Actually the tightest bound we can get is that one of
$a,b,c$ must be greater than $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205...$ which is where
the number $1.7$ comes from.}
\end{solution}
