\begin{problem}{Australian Math Olympiad 2021 --- P5/8}
Find the solutions to

$$
a^{2n} + b^{2n} = 1 \; \; \; \text{and} \; \; \; a^{2n+1} + b^{2n+1} = 1
$$

for positive integer $n$ and real numbers $a, b$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}{Solution}
Firstly we can assume without loss of generality that $a \geq b$, since
the equations have symmetry in $a, b$ and any solution $(a,b),\; a>b$ also
has $(b,a)$ as a solution. Indeed by re-arranging the second equation and multiplying the second equation by $a$ then re-arranging we derive that
$a^{2n+1} = 1 - b^{2n+1}$ and also $a^{2n+1} = a - ab^{2n}$
so $a-1 = ab^{2n} - b^{2n+1} \iff a = b^{2n} (a-b) + 1$ and so
$a \geq 1 \implies a^{2n} \geq 1$.
But since $a^{2n}, b^{2n}$ are both non-negative numbers and
$a^{2n} + b^{2n} = 1$ and $a\geq 1$ we have to have $a = 1, b = 0$. Now
clearly we can see that $(a,b,n) = (1, 0, n) \; \text{or} \; (0, 1, n)$
work for any positive integer $n$. $\blacksquare$
